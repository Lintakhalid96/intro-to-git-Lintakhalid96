I'm excited to learn about GitHub, a new platform. I'm a bit confused about using it professionally. I took this course to become an expert in computer languages. I want to work on developing codes for AMR (Antimicrobial Resistance) and health issues. I like the way we are learning through assignments and in easy friendly way.
